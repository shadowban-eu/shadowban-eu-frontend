                This type of ban causes an account to not populate search suggestions
                and people search results when it is searched for while being logged out.
                Twitter seems to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis#Metrics" target="_blank">tie strength</a> or a similar metric into account. While an account may be suggested to users you are strongly tied to, it may not be shown to others.

                This type of ban causes your tweets to be hidden from the search results
                entirely, no matter whether the quality filter is turned on or off.
                This behavior includes hashtags as well. It also means your replies
                (and other actions such as likes and retweets) won't show up in the
                notifications of other users, even if you follow each other.
                This type of ban seems to be temporally limited for active accounts.

                This is what is referred to as conventional shadowban or ghost banning as well. It comprises a
                search ban while threads are completely ripped apart by hiding reply tweets
                of the affected user to others. Everything will look perfectly normal to the
                affected user but many others will not be able to see reply tweets of the
                affected user at all. Reasons for this ban include behavior like excessive
                tweeting or following. Again, this type of ban seems to be temporally limited
                for active accounts.

	        If Twitter's signals determine that an account might engage in harmful behavior,
		Twitter hides their replies behind a barrier and only loads them when "Show more
		replies" is clicked. This behavior is personalized, i.e. Twitter does not hide
		the tweets of accounts you follow. We therefore use an unbiased reference account
		without followings in order to determine whether tweets within a thread can be
		retrieved without clicking "Show more replies" from its view.<br/>
		In some cases, Twitter classifies accounts to be offensive. In this case, replies
		are hidden behind a second barrier within the "Show more replies" section.

              But Twitter claims that they do not shadowban
            </div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
              In a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html">blog post from July 2018</a>,
              Twitter claims that they do not shadowban by defining shadowbanning as
              <i>deliberately making someone’s content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it, unbeknownst to the original poster</i>.
              If you strictly follow Twitter's own definition, this may not be false because the key is discoverability. Later, Twitter provides a hint why
              this definition is deceptive by stating that you are
              <i>always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile)</i>.
              The problem is obvious: Having to do more work to find tweets of accounts is not shadowbanning if you let Twitter define it. Although tweets within a thread
              may be completely invisible to others or tweets may not be shown in a user's followers' timelines, you will always be able to find those tweets by navigating
              to the user's "Tweets &amp; replies" section on their profile. In contrast to Twitter, we find that this is shadowbanning because without navigating there, it
              is not even possible for others to know that the corresponding tweets do exist.

              <h5>Quality Filter Discrimination</h5>
              <p>
                QFD caused your tweets to be invisible within the latest section of the
                search, including hashtags, when the quality filter on the search page was turned on.
                The filter was turned on by default
                and would reset for each search anew. QFD was introduced on May 15, 2018 as part of
                Twitter's so-called <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html">healthy conversation project</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality filter was deprecated shortly before Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey
                <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF00/20180905/108642/HHRG-115-IF00-Wstate-DorseyJ-20180905.pdf">testified before the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce</a>.
                In his testimony, Dorsey stated the following:<br/>
                <i>Twitter recently made a change to how one of our behavior based algorithms works in
                search results. When people used search, our algorithms were filtering out those that had a higher
                likelihood of being abusive from the “Lastest" tab by default. Those search results were visible
                in “Latest” if someone turned off the quality filter in search, and they were also in Top search
                and elsewhere throughout the product. Twitter decided that a higher level of precision is needed
                when filtering to ensure these accounts are included in “Latest” by default. Twitter therefore
                turned off the algorithm. As always, we will continue to refine our approach and will be
                transparent about why we make the decisions that we do.</i><br/>
                Currently, the quality filter seems to have no effect indeed. But please note that this is not a verification
                that users are not classified anymore by this algorithm. We just cannot observe it anymore through the quality filter.
              </p>

                      The quality filter within your notification settings only controls the

                      to see more notifications which you would not have received otherwise.
                      However, turning it off will not cause your own tweets to be more visible.

                      does not guarantee an account to be unaffected.

                      Several German Twitter users that were affected by QFD have been
                      experimenting with an Arabic follow-back botnet.
                      The botnet generated a lot of followers for those who followed some
                      accounts from this botnet. By accumulating many new followers that were not
                      affected by QFD, at least 30 accounts were able to escape this type of ban.
                      This is a strong hint that guilt by association is a major concept of the
                      classifying algorithm.

                      The quality filter indeed seems to mainly affect conservative and right-wing
                      accounts. Testing over 2,000 contacts of two German left-wing extremist
                      accounts did not yield a single account affected by QFD that would not be
                      considered politically right. Testing 509 Twitter accounts from German
                      members of Parliament yielded 14 affected accounts. All of them belong to
                      the AfD, which is a German right-wing party.

                      We cannot tell whether the effects of QFD are limited to hashtags and the
                      search. These are only the symptoms making the ban visible to us. It shows
                      that Twitter is capable and willing to discriminate against accounts with certain
                      political opinions. Since shadowbanning is a very unethical way to silence
                      people already, it is possible for Twitter to apply methods that are harder
                      to detect. Think of more subtle ways of banning by limiting the share of
                      followers who a user's tweets are shown to. This would be a censorship
                      method that could only be detected collectively by their followers.

                The Twitter search features several search modifiers. One of them is the prefix from:
                which allows to search for tweets from a specific user. For example, when checking
                whether
                <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu">
                  @shadowban_eu
                </a>
                has a shadowban, we query the Twitter search for
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=from%3A%40shadowban_eu&src=typd&qf=off">
                  from:@shadowban_eu
                </a>.
                If we do not find any tweets although the user has
                tweeted in the past, the account is subject to a search ban.
              </p>
              <h5>Thread Ban</h5>
              <p>
                When the user has a search ban, the tester searches their profile for the latest
                tweet with at least one reply. It then visits the direct URL of the tweet and
                selects some reply tweet. Afterwards, the direct URL of the reply tweet is visited.
                If the tweet that the user replied to is not visible, the likelihood that the
                account is affected by a thread shadowban is very high.
              </p>
              <h5>QFD (deprectated)</h5>
              <p>
                When you upload an image, cite a tweet or link to an external page, Twitter generates
                a shortlink for that content.
              </p>
              <p>
                We first find a reference tweet using a combination of from: and filter: search
                modifiers. For example,
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3A%40shadowban_eu%20filter%3Alinks&src=typd">
                  from:@shadowban_eu filter:links
                </a>
                returns all tweets from
                <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu">
                  @shadowban_eu
                </a>
                containing a link.
              </p>
              <p>
                We simply pick one result tweet as
                reference and extract the shortlink, e.g.
                <a href="https://t.co/5Vzu63ypQJ">
                  https://t.co/5Vzu63ypQJ
                </a>.<br />
                (This link points to a tweet, quoted <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu/status/1019242190277697538">here</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                We then query the Twitter search for the tweet using the shortlink's URL
                with the quality filter turned on and off.
                If the reference tweet is found in both
                cases, the account is not affected by QFD. In case it is found only when the filter
                is turned off, it is affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                We chose this method because shortlinks are unique. Methodically, it does not differ
                from searching for text or a hashtag but the uniqueness of shortlinks is a technical
                advantage.
